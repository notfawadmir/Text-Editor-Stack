Text Editor
A console-based text editor tool that allows users to easily insert text, delete text, and perform undo/redo operations using a stack-based approach. This tool provides a user-friendly interface for managing text, making it ideal for anyone looking to handle basic text editing functionalities in a programmatic way.

Features
Text Insertion
Insert text at the end of the current text.

Text Deletion
Delete the last specified number of characters from the current text.

Undo and Redo
Undo the last operation and restore the previous state.

Redo the last undone operation.

Customizable Interface
Console-based interactive interface for seamless navigation and operations.

Stack-based Operations
Uses two stacks for managing undo and redo functionalities.

How It Works
1. Inserting Text
Users can insert text at the end of the current content.

The current state is saved in the undo stack before the modification.

2. Deleting Text
Users can delete the last specified number of characters.

The current state is saved in the undo stack before the deletion.

3. Undo and Redo
Undo restores the text to its previous state.

Redo restores the text to the last undone state.

Customization
Headers and Footers: The current implementation focuses on basic text editing and does not include headers or footers (as these were not part of the initial code).

Undo and Redo Stack Size: You can manage the undo and redo operations with an unlimited history, which will grow dynamically as you continue to perform operations.

Dependencies
The application uses the following common libraries:

iostream (for input/output operations)

string (for handling string operations)

There are no additional external dependencies for this basic functionality.
